## 📌 Additional Nigerian Feature Ideas (Prioritized)

These are **extra** ideas (beyond the core list above) arranged by importance, with guidance on *where* to implement them and *why* they matter.

### 🟢 High Priority

#### 1. Rent Savings Wallet & Goal Tracker
- **Priority:** High  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Tenant `Profile` → `Payments` / `Wallet` section (e.g. `pages/tenant/payments`), with summary tiles on `Home` and `My Bookings`.  
  - Backend: Extend `payments`/`wallet` modules (savings goals, locked balances, transaction history).  
- **Reason:** Many Nigerians struggle to accumulate lump-sum rent; a structured savings flow directly tackles this pain.  
- **Expected impact:** Higher conversion from “interested” to “can actually pay”; stickier tenants who log in regularly to track savings.

#### 2. Shared Rent / Roommate Matching
- **Priority:** High  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: New `Find Roommate` flow under `Services` or `Home` quick actions; filters surfaced on `Properties` page (\"room-share available\").  
  - Backend: Matching service under `modules/properties` + a small `modules/matching` service for roommate profiles and preferences.  
- **Reason:** Shared apartments are common in Lagos/Abuja; most people currently use informal WhatsApp/Telegram groups.  
- **Expected impact:** New demand segment (students, junior staff), better occupancy for larger units, more network effects inside the platform.

#### 3. Transport-Aware Search
- **Priority:** High  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Extra filters on `Properties` search (\"Max commute time to VI/Ikeja/CMS\"), map overlays; a “Commute” tab on property details.  
  - Backend: Integration layer in `infrastructure/maps` to estimate commute times and typical costs using mapping APIs.  
- **Reason:** Lagos traffic is brutal; commute time is often more important than raw distance.  
- **Expected impact:** Differentiated search experience, higher search satisfaction, better match quality → fewer failed viewings.

#### 4. Tenant Scoring & Portfolio Risk Dashboard
- **Priority:** High (for B2B/professional landlords)  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Landlord `Dashboard` → `Risk` or `Portfolio Health` widget, plus risk badges on the `Applications` list.  
  - Backend: Scoring service in `modules/landlord` or `modules/risk` using payment history, disputes, and background check status.  
- **Reason:** Professional landlords think in terms of portfolio risk, not just single tenants.  
- **Expected impact:** Better pricing and approval decisions; strong selling point to serious landlords and PM firms.

#### 5. SLA Dashboard for Maintenance & Support
- **Priority:** High  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Landlord & Property Manager dashboards – SLA cards (avg response time, % completed within X hours) embedded in `maintenance` views.  
  - Backend: Metrics aggregation in `modules/property-management` and `modules/services` (timestamps on tickets and resolutions).  
- **Reason:** Landlords and PMs need proof of service quality to justify fees and keep tenants happy.  
- **Expected impact:** Clear value story for premium management; better tenant satisfaction and retention.

#### 6. Diaspora-Friendly Flow
- **Priority:** High (strategic segment)  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Special “I’m abroad” toggle in onboarding; property details and booking flows with “diaspora package” labels (virtual-only viewing, trustees, escrow).  
  - Backend: Policy flags in `modules/bookings` and `modules/payments` (extra checks, different escrow rules, KYC requirements).  
- **Reason:** Nigerians in UK/US/EU want to rent/buy/manage homes remotely but fear scams and poor oversight.  
- **Expected impact:** High-value ticket size, FX inflows, strong brand story (“safe for diaspora”), new revenue lines (concierge/inspection).

### 🟡 Medium Priority

#### 7. Emergency Repair Coverage Add-on
- **Priority:** Medium  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Optional toggle during booking/renewal checkout, and a card on `My Services` / `My Bookings`.  
  - Backend: Product config inside `modules/services` + `modules/payments` (coverage rules, pricing, claims workflow).  
- **Reason:** Tenants fear unexpected repair costs; landlords fear constant repair calls. A defined “emergency cover” creates clarity.  
- **Expected impact:** New recurring revenue stream; fewer disputes about who pays for what; better tenant experience.

#### 8. Automated Rent Review & Increment Suggestions
- **Priority:** Medium  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Landlord `Earnings` and `Properties` insights pages – “Suggested new rent range” with compare-to-market card.  
  - Backend: Analytics service using area benchmarks (from Julaaz data) under `modules/analytics` or `modules/properties`.  
- **Reason:** Many landlords either undercharge (fear vacancy) or overcharge (long vacancy) due to lack of data.  
- **Expected impact:** Better monetization per unit, more professional landlord behaviour, more trust in platform guidance.

#### 9. Bulk Onboarding Toolkit for Agents / Landlords
- **Priority:** Medium  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Landlord/Agent dashboard – “Bulk upload” wizard (CSV/Excel + validation UI).  
  - Backend: Import pipeline in `modules/properties` + background jobs in `infrastructure/queue` for processing large files.  
- **Reason:** Big landlords/agents won’t onboard one-by-one; they need a fast migration path.  
- **Expected impact:** Faster acquisition of large portfolios; easier switching from incumbent portals or offline spreadsheets.

#### 10. Tool & Material Financing for Artisans
- **Priority:** Medium  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Artisan `Profile` / `Earnings` page – “Get tools on credit” CTA.  
-  - Backend: Integration with lending partners via `infrastructure/finance` + artisan performance data from `modules/artisans`.  
- **Reason:** Better-equipped artisans deliver better service but often can’t afford tools up front.  
- **Expected impact:** Higher service quality, artisan loyalty, potential revenue share with finance partners.

#### 11. Certification & Upskilling Badges
- **Priority:** Medium  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Artisan & Service Provider profiles – badges, filter “Certified only” on services search.  
  - Backend: Store certs in `verification` / `artisans` modules; optional integration with local training bodies.  
- **Reason:** Quality differentiation is critical in Nigeria’s informal trades market.  
- **Expected impact:** Higher trust in artisans, better pricing power for certified pros, fewer bad jobs.

### 🟠 Nice-to-Have / Longer-Term

#### 12. Offline Agent / Field Mode
- **Priority:** Lower (but very valuable for ops)  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Lightweight PWA mode for Homerunners/agents (viewing & inspection flows) that caches forms/photos offline.  
  - Backend: Sync logic in `modules/homerunner` and `modules/inspections` to reconcile offline submissions.  
- **Reason:** Field work often happens in low-connectivity estates; offline robustness builds operational reliability.  
- **Expected impact:** Fewer failed inspections, better data quality, stronger service promise to landlords.

#### 13. Localised “Rent & Bills Stress Score”
- **Priority:** Lower (good UX differentiator)  
- **Where in app:**  
  - Frontend: Property details and comparison views show a simple score or badge (e.g. “Low/Medium/High total cost stress”).  
  - Backend: Calculation in `modules/analytics` combining rent, estimated utilities, commute and typical services spend.  
- **Reason:** People don’t think in just “rent”; they think in “total monthly burden”.  
- **Expected impact:** Better-informed tenants, fewer surprises post-move-in, strong marketing story (“honest total cost view”).
